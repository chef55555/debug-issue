## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project common-child` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project common-child`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project common-child` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.
